This release is a modifies the database.

1. Run
    python manage.py collectstatic
    
2. Run
    python manage.py syncdb
    
3. Go to cjp/scripts/load_scripts and run
    ./loadWords.py
This will take a long time.  I've slowed it
down in the hopes it doesn't hammer the
database too much and the process is just slow.
It will print a message for every 10 articles
it processes. There are 125000 articles to
process. I'm guestimating up to 36 hours.
