This release is a code-only release.  The database has not been changed.

You be able to put the code into production, and restart the server.

One note: in settings.py.  There is now a test of the enviroment variable 
CJP_DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT if this exists and has the value "TestConfig_1" then
a test configuration is used.  You can put other configs in there, just add
an elif test.  If the CJP_DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT is missing, the code assumes
it is running in production mode.

The reason for this is so that all the same settings are used in development
and production except for a few that change.
