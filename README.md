# Deployment

This is a standard Django project. The following information is specific to an Ubuntu based deployment using Nginx with Gunicorn. This information will not necessarily apply to all deployment setups. For details on deploying Django applications, see the Django deployment documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/howto/deployment/

Current deployment is done via reverse-proxied Nginx with gunicorn running the application. To acheive this, be sure gunicorn is running the application on a port. How you do this will vary according to your system. On Ubuntu, consider using Upstart to manage Gunicorn.

An example upstart config might look like this:

```
description "chicagojustice"

start on (net-device-up and local-filesystems)
stop on shutdown

respawn
console log
setuid cjp
setgid cjp

chdir /home/cjp/sites/chicagojustice
script
  exec /home/cjp/env/chicagojustice/bin/gunicorn -b :9000 conf.wsgi:application
end script
 ```

The application can then be managed via: `sudo service chicagojustice [start|stop|restart]`

Your Nginx configuration should contain information to proxy requests to the application port. E.g. (if running on port 9000):

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name http://data.chicagojustice.org/;
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/chicagojustice.log;
    client_max_body_size 5M;
    root /usr/share/nginx/chicagojustice;

    location / {
        try_files $uri @proxy_to_chicagojustice;
    }

    location @proxy_to_chicagojustice {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Note, the paths, users, groups, and all system specific information in the files above are for example purposes. Please check these against your system configuration.

## Code updates to the existing deployment

The code is deployed via git repository. Deployment of code changes should simply require `git pull` inside the application repository, and likely `sudo service chicagojustice restart` (please check the name of the service with what is in the upstart configs under `/etc/init`)

In some cases (ie. model changes) a schema migration is required. Migrate via `./manage.py migrate`. Be sure to source the virtual environment before running migrations. See the Django docs for details on schema migrations: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/migrations/
